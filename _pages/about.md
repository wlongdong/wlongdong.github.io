I am currently pursuing my M.Sc at SUSTech's [RCVLab](https://rcvlab.eee.sustech.edu.cn/), under the guidance of Prof. [Hong Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=J7UkpAIAAAAJ). Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology from Dalian Maritime University.

My research interests involve robotic manipulation and grasping, mobile manipulation, human-robot interaction, and semantic reasoning for robots. The ultimate goal is to develop autonomous agents that can perceive, reason, and interact with the physical world with the same level of Intelligence as humans.
